Task - ML Web App for Handwritten Digit Classifier


This project will help you understand the aspects of integrating Machine Learning Models within an application. In simple terms you will be making your first AI enabled application. 

The complete project has been broken down into 3 SPRINTs. Kindly follow the below mentioned SPRINT’s one at a time starting with the first SPRINT.

SPRINT - 1
Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
In this SPRINT, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 
Step 1 - Download the ‘mnist_data.zip’ and read the data in a pandas dataframe.
Step 2 - Use your ML Engineering skills to create a machine learning model which can classify the handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes.
Step 3 - Test and evaluate your model thoroughly.


SPRINT - 2
Step 1 - Use MS Paint to create some sample images. Click here to download sample images.
Step 2 - Properly test your model with newly created images.
Step 3 - Save the model on your computer inorder for productionisation.
Step 4 - Create a ‘Streamlit’ application where you can upload a Handwritten Image and get the prediction.
(HINT: Make sure to write the code for changing the resolution of uploaded image to 28*28)




SPRINT - 3
Step 1 - Use the HTML, CSS and JS code from ‘canvas_web_app.zip’ and create a Flask Web Application for the Drawing Board.
Step 2 - Make sure that the Flask Application works properly and the user should be able to draw anything on the board.
Step 3 - Add a button on the drawing board which can help users predict whatever is annotated on the board as mentioned below:
Display a button on the application for Prediction.
After the user draws a digit on the drawing board, and clicks on the ‘Predict’ button, it should display the digit that the user is trying to draw.
